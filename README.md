This project involves building a dynamic Todo list application using HTML, SCSS (following the BEM methodology), and TypeScript. The app will allow users to add and delete (mark as complete) tasks. It will also feature a greeting based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), along with a welcome message or a fact fetched from an external API.
